              <!--<h2>Introduction: Letting go of perfection</h2>-->
              <p>
                Embracing mistakes isn’t something I ever expected to enjoy, but the transformative journey at Ivey Business School has changed my perspective that perfection is the key to success. I’ve realized that solving business problems creatively often means thinking like kids—curious, playful, and unafraid to fail. If someone had told me six months ago that Ivey Business School—a global leader in case-based learning—would encourage me to embrace failure and unleash the kid in me, I would have laughed. Yet here I am, experimenting, exploring, making a mess, and finding joy in every step of the process.
              </p>
              <h2>A shift in perspective: Learning to fail and grow </h2>
              <p>
                Throughout my life, I was asked, taught, and trained to get things right—every time. But in the Design Driven Innovation course, Prof. Dr. Daniel Clark gave me the space to see that it's not just about getting things right. It's also about trying, failing, and learning along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though we’ve all heard the saying,<i>“Failure is the stepping stone to success,”</i> how often do we really appreciate someone who puts in the effort but fails? The truth is, we tend to celebrate success and overlook the value of attempts that didn’t go perfectly. But without those attempts—without failure—real learning never happens.
              </p>
              <h2>The problem with perfection: How fear of failure blocks creativity</h2>
              <p>
                From childhood, we’ve been taught to focus on getting the right answer, following rules, and sticking to frameworks. There’s little room to experiment, and because of that, we grow afraid of making mistakes. This pressure to avoid failure blocks us from exploring freely and keeps us focused on finding the “right” way rather than discovering new possibilities. It’s like our creativity gets boxed into a step-by-step manual with no space for detours or playful ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contrastingly in the Design Driven Innovation course at Ivey, we embraced the joy of making mistakes. Thanks to our professor’s guidance, we designed the worst water bottle possible for a client, tested different types of paper airplanes (some never made it off the ground), and built a spaghetti tower.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Our first in-class project challenged us to do the unexpected: design the worst possible prototype—a deliberate mistake. We brainstormed how to make the most impractical, dysfunctional water bottle for a specific client. This was both surprising and liberating. I never imagined feeling proud of making mistakes in a business school! We’re always told to learn from mistakes, but we spend so much time avoiding them. So where does real learning come from if we never let ourselves fail?
              </p>
              
              <h2>Lessons from kids: Building the spaghetti tower</h2>
              <p>
                Another fascinating activity involved building a spaghetti tower with limited supplies in just 15 minutes. Before we started, the professor shared a surprising fact: the average tower height built by kids is around 30 inches, while business school students usually manage only 20 inches. We couldn’t stop laughing—how could kids outdo us? Then, the professor said he’d help us reach the kids’ league of 30 inches.
              </p>
              <p>  
                So, we decided to replicate what kids would do. When you give a kid something new to play with, they don’t overthink it. They dive right in—stacking things, knocking them over, laughing, and trying again. They aren’t worried about getting it right the first time; they just explore. We followed that same mindset: <i>think, explore, and play</i>. For the first five minutes, we sketched different models of the tower individually. Then, as a team, we explored the mock supplies, experimenting with their characteristics, trying different structures, and making mistakes along the way. It was messy, chaotic, and fun. When the time came to use the real supplies, we built a 32.4-inch tower—in just 15 minutes!

              <h2>The Real Magic: Trying, Failing, and Growing</h2>
              <p>
                This experience taught me an important lesson: It’s not about getting it right at the first attempt or every time, but about valuing the effort—even when things go wrong. Mistakes are part of the process, not the end of it. And when we embrace failure as a step in learning, we unlock creativity and open ourselves to new possibilities. Whether we’re building towers, flying paper planes, or designing water bottles, the real magic happens when we tap into our inner child and give ourselves permission to try, fail, and grow.

        <p>
          There are moments in life that make you pause, reflect, and realize just how far you’ve come. Women Microsoft Day @ Ivey Business School was one of those moments for me. It was a day when I told myself, “You’ve got this. Be proud of who you are, and don’t let doubt dim your light.” 
          More than that, the event underscored the power of allyship and mentorship—a reminder that we thrive not just because of our own efforts but because of the people who believe in us. From heartfelt conversations to hands-on sessions exploring innovation and technology, the event was a powerful testament to the magic that happens when we lift each other up. Allyship doesn’t just help us succeed; it inspires others to do the same.
        </p>
        <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
        <p>
          When I was an Assistant Professor, I loved mentoring my students. I used to tell them, “Hold on to your network, even if it doesn’t help you right away. One day, it might change everything—for you or someone else.” Funny how advice can circle back to you when you least expect it. Sitting on the other side of the desk now, as an MBA candidate at Ivey Business School, I realized I needed the same reminder.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Women Microsoft Day, I found mentors in the most unexpected way—women who didn’t know me yet made me feel seen, valued, and supported. They reminded me that guidance transcends boundaries of age, experience, and even geography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, I was always the achiever. I thrived in academics, dazzled at annual day performances, and proudly collected awards for drawing and speech competitions. I worked hard, scored 93% in my 12th grade, and made it to one of the top universities in my state. But stepping into that unfamiliar world, surrounded by strangers and whispers about my background rather than my skills, a crack appeared in my confidence. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but that was when I began labeling myself an introvert. It became a label, a shield, and an excuse to stay in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, I kept pushing forward. I became a software engineer at Accenture, earned a university rank during my master’s program, and eventually followed my passion for teaching as an Assistant Professor. It was there I learned that the best teachers never stop being students. Listening, understanding, and adapting to others’ needs became my superpowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as I reflect now, I see how much self-doubt I carried with me. I was so busy building walls to protect myself that I forgot to let the light in. Women Microsoft Day broke through those walls and reminded me that confidence doesn’t come from hiding—it comes from leaning into your strengths and letting others see them too.
        </p>
        <h3>Lessons in Allyship and Mentorship</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most powerful moments at Women Microsoft Day was hearing <b>Rekha Narang, Director of Partner Technology at Microsoft</b>, say, “You’re here because you’re qualified.” Simple words, but they struck a chord. For so long, I had let questions about my capabilities fuel my doubts. Rekha’s advice was clear: Listen to those who believe in you. Build a network of believers and hold on to them tightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s what allyship is—having people in your corner who remind you of your worth, especially on the days when you forget it yourself. As a woman and a minority in the workplace, I’ve faced questions that made me second-guess myself. But that day, I realized something important: If my voice wasn’t being heard, it wasn’t because it wasn’t loud enough—it was because I needed to create a space for it.
        </p>
        <h3>Embracing Innovation and Growth</h3>
        <p>
          Women Microsoft Day wasn’t just about personal growth; it was a deep dive into the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in solving real-world problems. The <b>Azure AI Fundamentals session</b> provided a comprehensive overview of fundamental AI concepts and tools, showcasing how innovation and diversity of thought drive groundbreaking advancements. I explored technologies like <b>computer vision</b>, which interprets images and videos for applications like facial recognition, and <b>optical character recognition (OCR)</b>, which automates the extraction of text from scanned documents or images. These tools revealed how AI can enhance efficiency and open up new possibilities in various industries. Additionally, the session highlighted <b>text analysis</b>, where Azure’s Language Service analyzes sentiment, extracts key phrases, and identifies entities in text, and <b>Azure AI Speech</b>, which facilitates speech-to-text conversion, text-to-speech generation, and real-time translation to make communication more inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key takeaway was the importance of building AI responsibly. The discussions around <b>generative AI</b> emphasized the need for ethical practices to mitigate bias, ensure privacy, and maintain trust. Microsoft’s focus on responsible AI development, combined with practical insights into tools like Azure AI Document Intelligence and Responsible AI frameworks, reinforced the idea that technology can be both innovative and ethical. The day left me inspired by the potential of AI not just to automate and enhance processes but also to create opportunities that impact society positively. This experience solidified my commitment to embracing and contributing to the transformative power of technology.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
        <p>
          I walked away from Women Microsoft Day with more than just insights—I left with a renewed sense of purpose. I realized the power of allyship, the importance of mentorship, and the need to celebrate the unique journey that brought me here.
        </p>
        <p>
          For anyone out there doubting their capabilities or feeling like their voice isn’t being heard, I want to share what I learned:
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>Build a network of believers. </li>
        <li>Listen to your supporters, not your doubters.</li>
        <li>Never stop making space for your voice.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          To the incredible allies and mentors at Microsoft and Ivey—thank you for reminding me to believe in myself and inspiring me to do the same for others.
